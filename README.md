Get-AzurePublicIpList
=====================

            

 

When working with Azure firewall appliances and user-defined routing, it is helpful to have the list of Azure public IP addresses for the various Azure services and resources for the regions that you are using. Microsoft provides
 a XML file that you can download and then parse to import into your routes and firewalls, or you can use this script to automate that process. The script will download the XML file and list the subnets per region.

 


 

 

        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
